so basically i remembered making this after i got stuck so that i can see what i wanted to d o

rn im assigning values to all the halls, timings and courses

while also recording all of the clashes as specified by the user

now i only need to maintain a list of the number of clashes for each courses

now that we got the things that we need according to the rules that we set out in the beginning

we now need to like, enforce those rules

so first of all we are going to check the stuff that we need

oh and we're also going to get this on git, just to be sure 

now that we have added this to git, we can now go onto getting into the pre-chormosome generation checks

so basically we entered in the pre-generation rules checks, and now we move onto chromosome generation

to generate the chromosomes, we need to have our 4-5 pools of data, and then randomly get different indexes from them to generate our 
chromosomes
